# Motivation and Applications of Regression in Research

Regression analysis is a powerful statistical tool used in various research fields to understand the relationship between variables and make predictions. Regression analysis is also the workhorse of *Econometrics*, the  discipline in economics that studies specific statistical tools to study economic phenomena. 

Regression analysis is a powerful tool that allows a number of interesting applications in quantitative research. In this introductory section we will review a few, including extrapolating data, inferring causal relationships, and building predictive models.

**1. Data Extrapolation and Prediction:**

A first application of regression is the extrapolation of data.  Let me start illustrating this use with a case study I really like: how Xbox gaming data was used to predict the outcome of the 2012 US Presidential Election[^gelmanpaper]. 
[^gelmanpaper]: This is based on the paper. It is also discussed in Gelman's book. 

As you might be familiar, traditional polling methods, typically relying on phone surveys, are becoming increasingly ineffective due to declining response rates and biased samples. Surveys can be easily biased towards specific demographics. Recognizing this challenge, researchers proposed a novel approach: leveraging the vast pool of Xbox users to create a dataset that mirrored the demographic characteristics of the actual voting population. In first sight his might sound strange:
the Xbox users are also expected to be biased relative to the population, specifically to younger people. It turns out that Xbox users are also more likely to be male and XX.


researchers employed regression techniques to interpolate data points and predict voting patterns for various demographic groups. This involved creating a grid of different demographic profiles and estimating the voting tendencies of each group based on their characteristics. When data for specific combinations of characteristics was unavailable, the researchers used interpolation, relying on the results of similar demographic groups. Regression played a crucial role in this interpolation process, enabling the researchers to make predictions even from seemingly biased datasets.

This example highlights the potential of regression to uncover insights even from biased datasets, particularly when working with large data sources, often referred to as "Big Data." The lecture emphasizes the growing importance of leveraging these vast datasets to improve prediction accuracy, particularly in areas like political forecasting and market analysis.

**2. Inferring Causal Relationships:**

Beyond prediction, regression plays a crucial role in inferring causal relationships between variables. The lecture cites a quasi-experimental study on the impact of a housing subsidy program on domestic violence against women. This study was designed to assess whether the program, which used a lottery system to allocate housing, had any unintended consequences in terms of violence against women.

The researchers compared the experiences of those who received housing through the lottery with those who did not, providing a quasi-experimental setting to assess the program's effect. Using regression models, they estimated the causal effect of the program on domestic violence, taking into account other factors that could influence the outcome. This demonstrated the power of regression in assessing the causal impact of interventions, particularly when controlled experiments are difficult or unethical.

The lecture emphasizes that regression is particularly valuable for analyzing observational data, where random assignment to treatment and control groups is impossible. By carefully controlling for potential confounding variables through regression, researchers can estimate the causal effect of a particular intervention or factor on an outcome variable.

**3. Building Predictive Models:**

Regression is widely used to build predictive models, allowing researchers to estimate the value of a dependent variable based on the values of independent variables. This is evident in the "hedonic pricing model," commonly employed in real estate valuations.

The lecture describes this model as a framework for decomposing the value of a property into its observable characteristics, such as size, location, amenities, and construction regulations. The assumption is that each of these characteristics contributes to the overall value of the property. By applying regression, researchers can estimate the contribution of each characteristic to the overall property value. This information can then be used to predict the market price of properties based on their specific features. 

The lecture underscores that while the hedonic pricing model typically assumes linear relationships between variables, regression can be used to model non-linear relationships as well. By applying transformations to variables, researchers can capture more complex relationships between features and property value, improving the accuracy of the model.

These examples showcase the versatility of regression analysis. From predicting election outcomes to inferring causal relationships and building predictive models for real estate valuations, regression provides a robust framework for understanding complex phenomena and extracting valuable insights from data.
