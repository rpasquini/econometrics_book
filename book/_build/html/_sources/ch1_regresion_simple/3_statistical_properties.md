## Statistical Properties of Estimated Coefficients

Regression analysis, at its core, attempts to uncover the relationship between a dependent variable ($Y$) and one or more independent variables ($X$). This process involves estimating coefficients that represent the strength and direction of these relationships. However, it's crucial to recognize that the resulting coefficients are not absolute truths (what statisticians call the population parameters), but rather estimates derived from a sample of data. Understanding how reliable these estimations are is crucial for drawing valid conclusions about the relationships between variables. The statistical properties of these estimates that we review here are meant to understand this question. In particular, we will examine the unbiasedness property and the determinants of variance. In the next chapter, we will tackle additional properties that allow hypothesis testing. 


**1. Unbiasedness:** The first key property is that regression coefficients are **unbiased estimators**. This means that, on average, the estimated coefficients will equal the true population coefficients. Imagine repeating the regression analysis with different samples from the same population. While individual estimates may vary due to the inherent randomness of sampling, their average will converge toward the true value. This property ensures that our estimates are not systematically skewed in a particular direction, providing a level of confidence in their accuracy.

**Visualizing Unbiasedness:** Imagine we are trying to understand the relationship between the number of bedrooms in a rental property and its price. The true relationship, which we as researchers don't know, might be represented by a specific coefficient for "bedrooms". Let's say the true coefficient is 5,000, meaning that each additional bedroom increases the price by 5,000 units (e.g., pesos). If we were to repeatedly sample different sets of rental properties and run our regression, we would get slightly different estimates for the "bedrooms" coefficient each time. Some estimates might be closer to the true value of 5,000, while others might be slightly higher or lower. However, if we average all of these estimates together, we would find that the average is very close to the true value of 5,000. This demonstrates the concept of unbiasedness â€“ the estimates are not consistently overestimating or underestimating the true value; they are "centered" around it.

**2. Variance:** While unbiased, our estimates will always exhibit some degree of **variance**, which represents the uncertainty surrounding the estimated coefficient. This variance measures how much our estimated coefficients might deviate from the true population coefficients. A higher variance indicates a less precise estimate, meaning the true value could be further away from the estimated value. Conversely, a lower variance suggests a more reliable estimate, where the true value is likely closer to the estimated value. The variance of our estimates is influenced by two key factors:

- **Error in the model:** The presence of unexplained variation in the dependent variable (Y) contributes to the variance of our estimates. This error can be attributed to factors not included in the model (e.g., other variables influencing price beyond bedrooms) or inherent randomness in the data. For example, even with similar numbers of bedrooms, some properties might be located in more desirable areas, impacting their price beyond the simple bedroom count. This unexplained variation adds noise to our estimations.
- **Variability of the independent variable:** A greater spread in the values of our independent variable (X) leads to lower variance in our coefficient estimates. This is because a wider range of X values provides more information to estimate the relationship with Y. If we were to analyze properties with a narrow range of bedrooms, for example, only 1 or 2 bedrooms, we would have less data to accurately determine the relationship between bedrooms and price. In contrast, analyzing properties with a broader range, from studios to 5-bedroom houses, would provide more robust data to estimate the impact of bedrooms on price.

**Visualizing Variance:** Think about the scatter plot of our rental data. If the data points are tightly clustered around the regression line, our estimated coefficients will have low variance, indicating a more precise estimate. However, if the data points are scattered widely, our estimated coefficients will have higher variance, reflecting more uncertainty about the true relationship.
