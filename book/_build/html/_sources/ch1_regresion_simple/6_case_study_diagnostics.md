# Case Study: Diagnosing and Addressing Assumptions in a Housing Rental Model

This chapter demonstrates the practical application of diagnosing and addressing model assumptions using a case study of predicting housing rental prices in AMBA (Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area). We will:
Load and prepare the data: Using geopandas, we will load a dataset containing rental prices and the number of bedrooms in AMBA. We will then clean the data, handling missing values (NaNs) and ensuring the necessary variables are available for the model.
Estimate a basic linear regression model: We will estimate a linear regression model with rental price as the dependent variable and number of bedrooms as the independent variable. We will utilize the statsmodels library in Python to perform the regression analysis.
Diagnose model assumptions: We will visually inspect the residuals to assess linearity, homoscedasticity, and normality.
Linearity: A plot of residuals against the fitted values will be generated to identify any non-linear patterns.
Homoscedasticity: A plot of residuals against the independent variable (bedrooms) will be examined for variations in the spread of residuals.
Normality: A histogram of the residuals will be constructed to assess the normality of the error terms.
Address violations of assumptions: We will demonstrate how to address violations of normality and homoscedasticity by transforming variables and using robust standard errors.
Normality: If the normality assumption is violated, we will explore transforming the dependent variable (rental price) by taking its logarithm.
Homoscedasticity: We will implement robust standard errors in the regression model to account for heteroscedasticity.
Assess spatial autocorrelation: We will examine the spatial patterns of the residuals using a map to assess spatial autocorrelation. This involves plotting the residuals on a map of AMBA and observing if there are clusters of similar residuals in specific areas.
This case study will illustrate the practical steps involved in ensuring the robustness and reliability of regression models by scrutinizing and addressing model assumptions.
This section has provided a detailed overview of the key assumptions underpinning linear regression models, along with practical methods for diagnosing and addressing potential violations. The subsequent sections will provide a step-by-step guide to applying these techniques in a real-world case study.
