## Interpreting Regression Results

The output of a regression analysis, often presented in a table format, provides a wealth of information that needs careful interpretation to understand the relationships between variables and draw meaningful conclusions. Here are some key elements to consider:

**1. R-squared:** The R-squared value, often denoted as R2, measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable (Y) explained by the model. It essentially tells us how well the model fits the data. A higher R-squared indicates a better fit, meaning the model captures a larger portion of the variation in the dependent variable. For example, if R2 is 0.75, it means 75% of the variation in the dependent variable is explained by the independent variables included in the model.

**Important Note:** While a high R-squared is generally desirable, it doesn't necessarily imply a strong causal relationship. A model with a high R2 could still include irrelevant variables or be misspecified, leading to inaccurate conclusions.

**2. Coefficients:** The estimated coefficients represent the expected change in the dependent variable for each unit change in the corresponding independent variable, holding other variables constant. This is known as the **marginal effect**.

- **Positive Coefficient:** A positive coefficient indicates a **positive relationship** between the independent and dependent variables. For example, if the coefficient for "bedrooms" is 4,253, it means that for each additional bedroom in a rental property, the expected price increase is 4,253 units (e.g., pesos).
- **Negative Coefficient:** A negative coefficient suggests a **negative relationship**. For instance, if the coefficient for "distance from city center" is -100, it indicates that for every additional kilometer away from the city center, the price is expected to decrease by 100 units.

**3. Standard Error:** The standard error of a coefficient provides a measure of the variability of the estimate. It reflects the uncertainty around the estimated coefficient. A smaller standard error indicates a more precise estimate, suggesting that the true population coefficient is likely closer to the estimated value. A larger standard error reflects more uncertainty, meaning the true value could be further away from the estimate.

**4. T-statistic and P-value:** These values are used for hypothesis testing, particularly to determine if a particular coefficient is statistically significant.

- **T-statistic:** The T-statistic, as previously mentioned, is calculated by dividing the estimated coefficient by its standard error. A larger T-statistic suggests a stronger relationship and increases the likelihood of rejecting the null hypothesis of no effect.
- **P-value:** The P-value represents the probability of observing the estimated coefficient, or a more extreme value, if the null hypothesis were true. A low P-value (typically less than 0.05) indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis, leading to its rejection. This suggests a statistically significant relationship between the variables.

**Example Interpretation:** Let's revisit the example of rental property prices and bedrooms. Suppose we find that the coefficient for "bedrooms" is 4,253 with a standard error of 111. The T-statistic is calculated as 4,253 / 111 = 38.3. The P-value associated with this T-statistic is extremely low, practically zero. This indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis of no effect, allowing us to conclude that bedrooms significantly impact rental prices.

**Key Considerations:**

- **Units of Measurement:** It's crucial to remember the units of measurement for both the dependent and independent variables. The coefficient's interpretation is directly tied to these units.
- **Context Matters:** The interpretation of coefficients should always be considered within the context of the research question and the specific data being analyzed.
- **Model Limitations:** Regression models rely on assumptions about the data. Violating these assumptions can lead to biased estimates and incorrect conclusions. Careful model diagnostics are essential to ensure the validity of the results.

By carefully interpreting the R-squared, coefficients, standard errors, T-statistic, and P-value, researchers can gain valuable insights into the relationships between variables and draw meaningful conclusions from their regression analysis.
